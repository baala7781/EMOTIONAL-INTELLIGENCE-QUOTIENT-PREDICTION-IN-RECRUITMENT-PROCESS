# EMOTIONAL-INTELLIGENCE-QUOTIENT-PREDICTION-IN-RECRUITMENT-PROCESS
The suggested method automates the manual process of the recruiter analysing the emotional strength by attempting to estimate emotional intelligence quotient in persons based on parameters like age, location, and potential psychological tests.


Note: Use Jupyter Notebook; it is effective.


Steps to run the code:

pip install tkinter
pip install sklearn

#Step2

Then execute the section 1 code in a fresh Jupyter notebook cell.
The reading, loading, and modification of the data set are all contained in this Section 1 code.
also educating the model.
 

#Step 3

then close the gui


Step 4:
run the section 4 code in new cell
